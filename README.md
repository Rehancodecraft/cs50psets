# CS50 Problem Sets Solutions

Welcome to my **CS50 Problem Sets Solutions** repository! This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets from [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu), Harvard University's Introduction to Computer Science course.

## About CS50

CS50 is an introductory course in computer science offered by Harvard University. The course covers a wide range of topics, including algorithms, data structures, memory management, cryptography, web development, and more. The problem sets in CS50 are designed to reinforce the concepts learned in lectures.

## Contents

This repository contains solutions to the following problem sets:

- **Problem Set 1:** C Programming Basics
- **Problem Set 2:** Arrays and Loops
- **Problem Set 3:** Algorithms (Sorting and Searching)
- **Problem Set 4:** Memory (Pointers, Dynamic Memory Allocation)
- **Problem Set 5:** Data Structures (Hash Tables, Tries)
- **Problem Set 6:** Python Programming
- **Problem Set 7:** SQL and Databases
- **Problem Set 8:** Web Programming with Flask

Each problem set is located in its own directory and contains the necessary files and code required for each task.
