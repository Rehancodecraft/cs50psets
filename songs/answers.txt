Characterizing a listener's audio aura from a database containing their top 100 songs could involve analyzing several aspects of the songs to identify recurring patterns in genre, tempo, mood, and themes.


The calculated aura may not fully represent the listener because it overlooks emotional context, song variety, and how music is consumed (e.g., background vs. focused listening). A better approach would include listener sentiment during playback, time of day, mood tracking, and integrating personalized context (e.g., event-driven listening). Additionally, factoring in skips, replays, and playlist curation behavior would give a more accurate reflection of their true musical preferences.
